# MabiCommerce
This repository is the new home of https://github.com/Xcelled/mabicommerce

Updated for the most recent version of the game.

## Plans
A lot has changed in Mabinogi since 2022. Most notably there is now cross-continental trade. I want to incorporate these changes into this application because I believe it's a very useful tool. So here is a list of the planned additions:

### Update the codebase from .NET Framework 4.7 to .NET 7
This has been a long time coming for this app, and pretty much the whole reason for the new repository. The codebase was very outdated. Props to the original creators for thinking about this ahead of time as it will make the transition much easier, but the barebones of the application was created in 2016! It's a long story, but it essentially boils down to Microsoft changing their philosophy about C#. With this new codebase the application should be able to run on all Windows platforms, along with additional future-proofing so that it can more easily be updated in the future.


### Add the big "Commerce Update"
Mabinogi has added a whole lot to commerce since 2022. I plan to add the new routes (Filia, Vales, etc), the new transportation methods (Dog Sled, Camel, etc.), and new items. This will take a while as the routes are very lengthy, so bare with me.

### Reformat the Application
There are quite a few UI changes that I want to make because, while it looks great in it's own right, I believe it could look better.

And that's just about it.
